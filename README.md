# Tea-Feature-Templates

When you decide to use TEA architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 4 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules...I was suffering this problem, and this is the raison why I've created this template. It's very useful for me and I hope that for you too.

## Installation

1. Open Finder, press **`Shift +Command + G`** and paste the following path:

`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates`

2. Paste TEA Feature.xctemplate into this folder

3. Now, when you going to create a new File, you see something like the following image:
